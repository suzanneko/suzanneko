### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± I started my coding journey in December 2022 when I joined a HyperionDev coding bootcamp funded by the DfE. I was a little apprehensive about completing the course whilst looking after my baby daughter full time, but I was really excited by the prospect of all the learning that I would be doing. The course has opened my eyes in so many ways to the fascinating world of tech! I found that I really enjoyed the bootcamp and particularly the discipline of coding itself, which I found suits my analytical, logical thinking and my enjoyment of problem solving. Before this, I worked in teaching for over 10 years, and I am ready to explore new opportunities and take on new challenges in the tech world.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building my first webpage using HTML and CSS.
